## Welcome to the BRIDGE Center Wiki!
As we work on the launch of the official BRIDGE Center website, this wiki will be your source for BRIDGE Center documentation and resources. 

Any questions or comments about these documents or resources should be directed to John Pyles, Scientific Operations Director: [jpyles@cmu.edu](mailto:jpyles@cmu.edu)

### BRIDGE Center Manual
The BRIDGE Center Manual is your source for information on policies, procedures, how-to and safety at the BRIDGE Center. The manual is updated regularly and the latest version will always be posted here. You can find earlier versions as Word docs with track changes in the [BRIDGE-Manual-History](https://github.com/BRIDGE-Center/BRIDGE-Public-Wiki/tree/master/BRIDGE-Documents/BRIDGE-Manual-History) folder. Starting in v1.6 there will also be a changes Appendix.

### Project Registration Form
All projects conducted at the BRIDGE Center need to be registered through the Project Registration Process (BRIDGE Manual section 2.2).

### BRIDGE Grants
The BRIDGE Center currently offers two grants for scanning hours.

_**BRIDGE Seed Grants**_\
Download information and instructions: [CMU-Pitt-BRIDGECenterSeedGrants.pdf](https://github.com/BRIDGE-Center/BRIDGE-Public-Wiki/blob/master/BRIDGE-Documents/CMU-Pitt-BRIDGECenterSeedGrants.pdf)

_**BRIDGE Jump Start Grants**_\
BRIDGE Center Jump Start Grants are small grants of less than 10 hours of scanning time intended to provide a way to quickly collect pilot data or test a new method or experimental design. There is a simple one page application that will be reviewed and approved by the Scientific Operations Director. (Note that data collection will require IRB and BRIDGE Project Registration if it does not fall under the protocol of an existing project.) If you would like to apply, complete the application and return it as a Word doc to John Pyles (jpyles@cmu.edu) along with the CVs of the project leaders.
